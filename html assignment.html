    Later years
</h1>

<p>
    In 1956, despite warnings from P. Kakkan, the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, 
    Ramasamy organised a procession to the Marina to burn pictures of the Hindu God Rama.Ramasamy was subsequently
     arrested and confined to prison.The activities of Ramasamy continued when he went to 
     Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All India Official Language Conference. 
     There he stressed the need to retain English as the Union Official Language instead of Hindi.
      Five years later, Ramasamy travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the caste system. 
      In his last meeting at Thiagaraya Nagar, Chennai on 19 December 1973, Ramasamy declared a call for action to 
      gain social equality and a dignified way of life. On 24 December 1973, Ramasamy died at the age of 94.

<h1 class="title-PERIYAR">
    Comparisons with Gandhi
</h1>
 
<p>"With all his good qualities, Gandhi did not bring the people forward from foolish and evil ways.
     His murderer was an educated man. Therefore nobody can say this is a time of high culture.
     If you eat poison, you will die. If electricity hits the body, you will die. If you oppose the Brahmin,
      you will die. Gandhi did not advocate the eradication of Varnasrama Dharma structure, but sees in it a task for the
      humanisation of society and social change possible within its structure. The consequence of this would be continued high-caste leadership.
       Gandhi adapted Brahmins to social change without depriving them of their leadership".
